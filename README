ABOUT
	Test::Critic is a companion to the Perl::Critic module.  If
	you already use Perl::Critic to help enforce coding standards,
	Test::Critic allows you to integrate enforcement directly into
	your build proceess.

	Much the same way that Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage
	create test cases to verify the quality of your documentation,
	Test::Perl::Critic creates test cases to verify the "kwalitee"
	of your code.

	See the POD documentation for all the gory details.

PREREQUISITES

	Test::Perl::Critic requires the following modules:

	* Test:::More
	* Perl::Critic
	
	For complete build tests, I also suggest the following:

	* Test::Pod
	* Test::Pod::Coverage

INSTALLATION

	See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
