NAME
    Test::Perl::Critic - Use Perl::Critic in test programs

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::Perl::Critic;

      critic_ok($file);                          #Test one file
      all_critic_ok($dir_1, $dir_2, $dir_N );    #Test all files in several $dirs
      all_critic_ok()                            #Test all files in distro

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Perl::Critic wraps the Perl::Critic engine in a convenient
    subroutine suitable for test programs written using the Test::More
    framework. This makes it easy to integrate coding-standards enforcement
    into the build process. For ultimate convenience (at the expense of some
    flexibility), see the criticism pragma.

SUBROUTINES
    critic_ok( FILE [, TEST_NAME ] )
            Okays the test if Perl::Critic does not find any violations in
            FILE. If it does, the violations will be reported in the test
            diagnostics. The optional second argument is the name of test,
            which defaults to "Perl::Critic test for FILE".

    all_critic_ok( [@DIRECTORIES] )
            Runs "critic_ok()" for all Perl files beneath the given list of
            directories. If given an empty list, the function tries to find
            all Perl files in the blib/ directory. If the blib/ directory
            does not exist, then it tries the lib/ directory. Returns true
            if all files are okay, or false if any file fails.

            If you are building a module with the usual CPAN directory
            structure, just make a t/perlcritic.t file like this:

              use Test::Perl::Critic;
              all_critic_ok();

            Or if you use the latest version of Module::Starter::PBP, it
            will generate this and several other standard test programs for
            you.

    all_code_files ( [@DIRECTORIES] )
            DEPRECATED: Use the "all_perl_files" subroutine that is exported
            by Perl::Critic::Utils instead.

            Returns a list of all the Perl files found beneath each
            DIRECTORY, If @DIRECTORIES is an empty list, defaults to blib/.
            If blib/ does not exist, it tries lib/. Skips any files in CVS
            or Subversion directories.

            A Perl file is:

            * Any file that ends in .PL, .pl, .pm, or .t
            * Any file that has a first line with a shebang containing
            'perl'

CONFIGURATION
    Perl::Critic is highly configurable. By default, Test::Perl::Critic
    invokes Perl::Critic with it's default configuration. But if you have
    developed your code against a custom Perl::Critic configuration, you
    will want to configure Test::Perl::Critic to do the same.

    Any arguments given to the "use" pragma will be passed into the
    Perl::Critic constructor. So if you have developed your code using a
    custom ~/.perlcriticrc file, you can ask Test::Perl::Critic to use a
    custom file too.

      use Test::Perl::Critic (-profile => 't/perlcriticrc');
      all_critic_ok();

    Now place a copy of your own ~/.perlcriticrc file in the distribution as
    t/perlcriticrc. Then, "critic_ok()" will be run on all Perl files in
    this distribution using this same Perl::Critic configuration. See the
    Perl::Critic documentation for details on the .perlcriticrc file format.

    Any argument that is supported by the Perl::Critic constructor can be
    passed through this interface. For example, you can also set the minimum
    severity level, or include & exclude specific policies like this:

      use Test::Perl::Critic (-severity => 2, -exclude => ['RequireRcsKeywords']);
      all_critic_ok();

    See the Perl::Critic documentation for complete details on it's options
    and arguments.

DIAGNOSTIC DETAILS
    By default, Test::Perl::Critic displays basic information about each
    Policy violation in the diagnostic output of the test. You can customize
    the format and content of this information by giving an additional
    "-verbose" option to the "use" pragma. This behaves exactly like the
    "-verbose" switch on the perlcritic program. For example:

      use Test::Perl::Critic (-verbose => 6);

      #or...

      use Test::Perl::Critic (-verbose => '%f: %m at %l');

    If given a number, Test::Perl::Critic reports violations using one of
    the predefined formats described below. If given a string, it is
    interpreted to be an actual format specification. If the -verbose option
    is not specified, it defaults to 3.

        Verbosity     Format Specification
        -----------   --------------------------------------------------------------------
         1            "%f:%l:%c:%m\n",
         2            "%f: (%l:%c) %m\n",
         3            "%m at line %l, column %c.  %e.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         4            "%f: %m at line %l, column %c.  %e.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         5            "%m at line %l, near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         6            "%f: %m at line %l near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         7            "[%p] %m at line %l, column %c.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         8            "[%p] %m at line %l, near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
         9            "%m at line %l, column %c.\n  %p (Severity: %s)\n%d\n",
        10            "%m at line %l, near '%r'.\n  %p (Severity: %s)\n%d\n"

    Formats are a combination of literal and escape characters similar to
    the way sprintf works. See String::Format for a full explanation of the
    formatting capabilities. Valid escape characters are:

        Escape    Meaning
        -------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        %m        Brief description of the violation
        %f        Name of the file where the violation occurred.
        %l        Line number where the violation occurred
        %c        Column number where the violation occurred
        %e        Explanation of violation or page numbers in PBP
        %d        Full diagnostic discussion of the violation
        %r        The string of source code that caused the violation
        %P        Name of the Policy module that created the violation
        %p        Name of the Policy without the Perl::Critic::Policy:: prefix
        %s        The severity level of the violation

CAVEATS
    Despite the obvious convenience of using test programs to verify that
    your code complies with coding standards, it is not really sensible to
    distribute your module with those test programs. You don't know which
    version of Perl::Critic the user has and whether they have installed
    additional Policy modules, so you can't really be sure that your code
    will pass the Test::Perl::Critic tests on another machine.

    The easy solution is to add your perlcritic.t test program to the
    MANIFEST.SKIP file. When you test your build, you'll still be able to
    run the Perl::Critic tests with "make test", but they won't be included
    in the tarball when you "make dist".

    See
    <http://www.chrisdolan.net/talk/index.php/2005/11/14/private-regression-
    tests/> for an interesting discussion about Test::Perl::Critic and other
    types of author-only regression tests.

EXPORTS
      critic_ok()
      all_critic_ok()

PERFORMANCE HACKS
    If you want a small performance boost, you can tell PPI to cache results
    from previous parsing runs. Most of the processing time is in
    Perl::Critic, not PPI, so the speedup is not huge (only about 20%).
    Nonetheless, if your distribution is large, it's worth the effort.

    Add a block of code like the following to your test program, probably
    just before the call to "all_critic_ok()". Be sure to adjust the path to
    the temp dir appropriately for your system.

        use File::Spec;
        my $cache_path = File::Spec->catdir(File::Spec->tmpdir,
                                            "test-perl-critic-cache-$ENV{USER}");
        if (!-d $cache_path) {
           mkdir $cache_path, oct 700;
        }
        require PPI::Cache;
        PPI::Cache->import(path => $cache_path);

    We recommend that you do NOT use this technique for tests that will go
    out to end-users. They're probably going to only run the tests once, so
    they will not see the benefit of the caching but will still have files
    stored in their temp dir.
