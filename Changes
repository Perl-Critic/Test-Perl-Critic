[1.02] Released on 2009-10-22

     Documentation changes.  META.yml "enhancements".  Moved author
     tests out of the way of normal testing.

     Now requires Perl-Critic version 1.105 or newer.  Fixed source
     code to be compliant with this version. Reported by Xavier Caron.

[1.01] Released on 2007-01-24

     PRODUCTION RELEASE: You may now consider the public API of
     Test::Perl::Critic as stable.

     Edited documentation.  Includes better example for using
     Test::Perl::Critic in CPAN distributions.

     Added a t/perlcritic.t test to further demonstrate the typical
     usage for CPAN distributions.

     No code changes.

[0.08] Released on 2006-11-05

     All parameters to Test::Perl::Critic can now be controlled through
     the .perlcriticrc file.  See the Perl::Critic POD for more info.

     Now compatible with the perlcritic.t test script that is generate
     by Module::Starter::PBP.  In my humble opinion, the test script
     is flawed, but at least it will work now.

[0.07] Released on 2006-08-20

     All exceptions during testing are now fatal.

     Now supports -verbose option, just like `perlcritic` does.

     Added support for PPI::Cache, which can speedup repeated tests.
     See Test::Perl::Critic documentation for more details.

     Now requires Perl-Critic version 0.19 or higher.

[0.06] Released on 2006-05-14

     No functionality changes or bug fixes, just refactorings.

     The all_code_files() function is now deprecated.  See
     all_perl_files() in Perl::Critic::Utils instead

     Now requires Perl::Critic version 0.15_03 or higher.

[0.05] Released on 2006-03-26

     Modified import() interface to pass all arguments to Perl::Critic.
     This give you a direct hook to configure Perl::Critic and
     should still be backward compatible.

[0.04] Released on 2006-01-15

     Updated to be compatible with Perl-Critic 0.14, but is not
     backward compatible with older versions of Perl-Critic.  If
     you want to use the -severity option with Perl-Critic, you
     need to use Perl-Critic version 0.14 or later.

[0.03] Released on 2005-10-31

     Now catching exceptions from Perl::Critic so the tests fail
     gracefully if PPI has errors.

     Added -format option, which is similar to the -verbose option
     that perlcritic has.  I'm not sure why I didn't make it exactly
     the same.

     Added a few more test cases.  In general, this module doesn't
     have very good test coverage because I haven't really figured 
     out how to test a Test.

[0.02] Released on 2005-09-30

     Some minor tweaks; Edited POD.

     Removed Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage from the prerequisites 
     list.  Those tests only run if the modules are installed.

     Test::Perl::Critic is going to require Perl::Critic version 0.08 
     or later, or it won't pass its own criticism tests.

[0.01] Not released
