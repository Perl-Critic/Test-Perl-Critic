[0.03] Released on 051031

     Now catching exceptions from Perl::Critic so the tests fail
     gracefully if PPI has errors.

     Added -format option, which is similar to the -verbose option
     that perlcritic has.  I'm not sure why I didn't make it exactly
     the same.

     Added a few more test cases.  In general, this module doesn't
     have very good test coverage because I haven't really figured 
     out how to test a Test.

[0.02] Released on 050930

     Some minor tweaks; Edited POD.

     Removed Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage from the prerequisites 
     list.  Those tests only run if the modules are installed.

     Test::Perl::Critic is going to require Perl::Critic version 0.08 
     or later, or it won't pass its own criticism tests.
